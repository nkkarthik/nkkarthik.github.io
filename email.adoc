== rancher customizations

Hi Dave,

Feroz and I were discussing few customizations that are specific to our organization's use cases.
We want to check with your team on how to go about it (recommended approach, integration practice, suggestions etc).

I am including details below to us save some time,
but kindly forward.

1. We want to link certain resources together.
Say a certain `Service` resource will have a corresponding `Infoblox` (our custom) resource.
For this we are thinking to have a management/user controller.
If the approach is correct, how should we integrate with Rancher server.

2. Include custom UI pieces for our users.  For example see below in the highlighted the information that is custom.
What are your recommendations here?
